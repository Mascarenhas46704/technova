Our ADR detection system collects patient symptoms and current medications to evaluate potential adverse drug reactions.  
It uses a robust, rule-based approach by comparing inputs against a comprehensive set of predefined rules.  
These rules map common symptoms to medications known to sometimes trigger ADRs.  
The system processes inputs quickly and generates immediate alerts for dangerous combinations.  
A lightweight machine learning model is integrated to identify subtler patterns beyond the obvious.  
The intuitive graphical interface ensures ease-of-use for busy clinicians and self-reporting patients.  
Alerts are clearly displayed with severity indicators, aiding prompt clinical decision-making.  
The tool can be used both at the point of care by doctors and for ongoing symptom tracking by patients.  
It seamlessly fits into clinical workflows, enhancing patient safety and data accuracy.  
Overall, this ADR detection system empowers healthcare professionals with timely, actionable insights.
